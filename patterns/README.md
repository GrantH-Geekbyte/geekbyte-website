# Pattern Library

Starts empty. Patterns grow from real work — not upfront design.

## When to Create a Pattern
- Same type of review done 3+ times with the same checks
- Gate rejection reveals a check that should be standard
- Escape reveals a missing verification
- Same architectural guidance given repeatedly

## Expected First Patterns (will emerge from SPEC-001 and following specs)
- PATTERN-ARCH-STATIC-PAGE
- PATTERN-QA-STATIC-PAGE
- PATTERN-QA-LINK-VERIFICATION
- PATTERN-DEPLOY-STATIC-SITE

Don't create these now. Let them emerge.

## Pattern Format
See SDD v3.0 Section 7.2 for full YAML structure.
