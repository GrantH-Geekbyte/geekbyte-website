# Velocity Baseline — Adoption Phase (Day 0-90)

Focus: Is the pipeline working at all?

## Completed Specs

| Spec ID | Title | Tier | Started | Completed | First-Pass Gates | Escapes |
|---------|-------|------|---------|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| | | | | | | |

## Notes
- Don't optimize during Adoption — run specs through and capture what happens
- First 5-10 specs establish the baseline
- Track friction informally: what feels slow, confusing, or unnecessary
