# Escalation Protocols

## Tier Dispute
Use the higher tier until resolved. Document reasoning in spec.

## Emergency Bypass
1. Fix the production issue immediately
2. Document bypass justification within 24 hours
3. Retrospective gate review within 48 hours
4. Log as learning event

## Spec Ambiguity During Implementation
1. Stop implementation on the ambiguous portion
2. Flag with options
3. Grant resolves and updates spec
4. Re-approval from affected gates if scope/architecture changed

## Pattern Disagreement
Grant's judgment prevails. Log disagreement as learning event for quarterly review.

## External Review Triggers
- Any Critical tier spec
- First new architectural pattern
- Uncertainty after agent review
- Annual pipeline audit
