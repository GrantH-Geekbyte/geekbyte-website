## KEY DIFFERENCES FROM AI-NATIVE VERSION

**Headlines:**
- BEFORE: "Technical Leadership for Companies Building with AI"
- AFTER: "Technology Leadership for PE Portfolio Companies"

**Bio Title:**
- BEFORE: "Fractional CTO | Independent Board Member | AI Development Advisor"
- AFTER: "Fractional CTO | Independent Board Member | PE Technology Advisor"

**Value Propositions:**
- BEFORE: AI-native development, pattern recognition, advisory vs implementation
- AFTER: Proven PE track record, pattern recognition from scale, executive-level perspective

**AI Mention:**
- BEFORE: Central to all sections, mentioned in headlines and opening paragraphs
- AFTER: One sentence in final bio paragraph, positioned as recent advisory work

**Tone Shift:**
- BEFORE: AI-native technical leadership (forward-looking, emerging capability focus)
- AFTER: PE operating experience (backward-looking, proven track record focus)

**Target Audience:**
- BEFORE: CTOs/VPs navigating AI adoption
- AFTER: PE firms and portfolio companies needing technology leadership

---

**Marketing-copywriter recommendations:**
- Use Primary Recommendation for all sections (most balanced PE-first positioning)
- Consider adding logos (ECI, Sage, Cinch Ops) if permitted
- Consider adding results callout boxes ("2 PE exits," "27+ acquisitions," "15 cloud migrations")
- Consider testimonial from PE partner or portfolio company CEO
