                        <p>Grant Howe brings 25+ years of technology executive experience across multiple successful PE exits. As Global CTO at ECI Software Solutions, he led technology strategy through two PE transactions, integrated 27+ acquisitions, and migrated 15 on-premise products to cloud SaaS—tripling company revenue during his tenure.</p>

                        <p>Prior to ECI, Grant served as SVP of R&D at Sage, driving the technology organization through significant ARR growth and a successful exit to Accel-KKR. His technical foundation includes hands-on development of enterprise-grade security platforms, performance monitoring systems, and USPS-certified software—giving him the credibility to evaluate architecture decisions at the code level.</p>

                        <p>Grant currently serves as an independent board member at Cinch Ops and provides fractional CTO and advisory services to PE-backed portfolio companies. His focus is on technology strategy, M&A integration, technical due diligence, and exit readiness—helping companies avoid expensive mistakes and accelerate value creation.</p>

                        <p>Grant's cross-sector experience spans manufacturing, distribution, field service, nonprofit, and enterprise software—giving him the pattern recognition to identify what works across different technical and business contexts. Recent advisory work includes helping CTOs navigate AI adoption strategies and architecture decisions for companies building new AI-native capabilities.</p>
