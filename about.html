                        <p>Grant Howe brings 25+ years of technology executive experience with a current focus on AI-native product development. As Global CTO at ECI Software Solutions, he led technology strategy through two successful PE exits, integrated 27+ acquisitions, and migrated 15 on-premise products to cloud SaaS.</p>

                        <p>Prior to ECI, Grant served as SVP of R&D at Sage, driving the technology organization through significant ARR growth and a successful exit to Accel-KKR. His technical foundation includes hands-on development of enterprise-grade security platforms, performance monitoring systems, and pioneering work on USPS-certified software systems.</p>

                        <p>Today, Grant advises CTOs and engineering leaders navigating AI adoption—helping teams build AI-native architectures from the ground up rather than retrofitting legacy systems. He serves on the board of Cinch Ops and works with PE portfolio companies on technical strategy, architecture decisions, and engineering team assessment.</p>

                        <p>Grant's cross-sector experience spans manufacturing, distribution, field service, nonprofit, and enterprise software—giving him the pattern recognition to identify what works across different technical and business contexts. His approach combines hands-on AI development expertise with the executive perspective that comes from multiple successful exits.</p>
