                        <p class="bio-title">Fractional CTO | Independent Board Member | Growth Advisor</p>
                        <p>Grant Howe is a technology executive with over 25 years of experience building and scaling software organizations. As Global CTO at ECI Software Solutions, he led technology strategy through two successful PE exits, integrated 27+ acquisitions, and migrated 15 products from on-premise to cloud SaaS while tripling company revenue.</p>
                        <p>Prior to ECI, Grant served as SVP of R&D at Sage, where he drove ARR growth from $27M to $85M and led the technology organization through a successful exit to Accel-KKR (becoming Abila).</p>
                        <p>Today, Grant helps PE partners and portfolio companies through Geekbyte LLC, providing Fractional CTO services and independent board advisory. He currently serves on the board of Cinch Ops, bringing enterprise-scale governance to growth-stage companies.</p>
                        <p>Throughout his 25-year career, Grant has built deep expertise across manufacturing, distribution, field service, nonprofit, government, and enterprise software sectors—navigating every delivery model from on-premise to hosted to cloud SaaS. His technical foundation includes developing enterprise-grade security, performance monitoring, and systems administration platforms, including pioneering work creating the first smart stamp software for the US Postal Service. This combination of hands-on technical depth and cross-sector experience enables Grant to identify patterns and solutions that others miss.</p>
