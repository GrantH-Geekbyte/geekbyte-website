                <h2>Why PE Portfolio Boards Need Technology Expertise</h2>
                <div class="intro-text">
                    <p>Technology risk can destroy multiples. Technical debt, security vulnerabilities, scalability issues, and cloud migration failures all impact exit value. Yet most portfolio company boards lack the technical expertise to identify these risks before they become problems.</p>
                    <p>Geekbyte brings the perspective of executives who have been through multiple successful PE exits. We know what buyers find in technology due diligence, what drives multiples higher, and what red flags cause deals to fall apart. That's the oversight we provide to your portfolio company boards.</p>
